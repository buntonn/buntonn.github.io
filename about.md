I am nick Bunton a software devloper who has been getting back upto speed with web development. When I stopped to do server side Java development it was mainly HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a few libraries...

Now I come back and we have ES6, React, Angular and a ton more libraries and components... Not to mention the array of tooling to go with it, so it's been a learing curve and I have got a lot from the extreamly kind community, so I wanted to give something back!
